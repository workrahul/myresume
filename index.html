    <H2>WORK EXPERIENCE</H2>
    <P>work experience section is where you get to really sell yourself, so you have to make sure you really iron out
        the details and the formatting makes sense.

        This is where you get to show off your best qualities.

        Because, if the recruiter is going to pick between 10 different candidates, you know for a fact they’re going to
        narrow down the list starting with the most relevant experience.

        To get your work experience to really shine on your resume, first, we’re going to cover the basic formatting,
        and then get to the best practices on how to stand out with your work experience section.

        What’s that? You don’t have any experience to begin with? No problem!</P>
